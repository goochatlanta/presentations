# Literature on a Legacy?

### Through Investment
Eisenmann (2018) - **Red China's Green Revolution**

1. Increasingly *aggressive agricultural investments* made during 1960s and 1970s.
2. Maintance of *asture living conditions* in agricultural areas dicated by communal leadership. 
3. Daily lives of peasants *facilitated by the commune system*. 

### Through Famine - *Health-specific*
Ha and Fund (2002) find that the detrimental impact of starvation had intergenerational consequences. 

### Through Famine - *General*
Gooch (2017) finds that the Great Famine impacted economic development.

# Identifying a Legacy on Development

### Conceptually & Methodologically
### Empirically

# Evaluating a Detrimental Policy

### Locate a Time-invariant Influencer on Application

Ruggedness affects the ability of the government to monitor and implement policies (*this is from the development literature.*) 

- Nunn and Puga (2012) show that ruggedness in Africa played a role in protecting African's from the slave traders. 

### Temporally-specific Factor

Politics played a large role in difference in Great Leap Forward application (*this is from the literature on the Great Leap*.)

1. Special promotion of a 1st Party Secretary between 1956 and 1959
2. Inflation Rate for Great Output in 1959
3. Dining Hall Participation Rate in 1959
---

# Interaction Effect

### Simply modeled: 

$y_i=\beta_0 + \beta_1 Politics_j + \beta_2 Ruggedness_i + \beta_3 Politics_j \times Ruggedness_i$

where:
- $Ruggedness_i$ is a characteristics of the district and 
- $Politics_j$ is a province-level measure of ideology just before the Great Leap began. 

### Additional considerations

1. Province fixed effects
2. Covariates that may also influence implementation choices of the Great Leap.
